# PiWeather
Raspberry Pi Weather Station

This is an evolving project that I started so I could learn Python, Arduino, PHP, HighCharts, javascript, and MySQL. There is of course a lot of room for improvement, but it's all working. 

For the Stevenson Screen I used the following design to 3D

For the PiZero case I used a design form thingiverse. I have since lost it, but any should do. 

For the Gas Sensor and Teensy, I used RS's DesignSpark Mechanical (https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/home) to draw the parts to print.

Sources (that I remembered, some I think are noted in the python files):

There was a lot of information on stack overflow and the Pi forum
